Dutch singer {{w|Duncan Laurence}} won the 2019 edition of Eurovision in [[Tel Aviv]] winning 498 points for his song ''{{w|Arcade (song)|Arcade}}''.  That victory meant Netherlands was to host the competition 2020, which was cancelled because of "escalating spread of [[COVID-19]] throughout Europe".  This year, 3500 people were in audience, multiple reports stated.  They all were tested negative to be eligible for attending the event, Eurovision stated.

[[Iceland]]'s {{w|DaÃ°i Freyr}} could not perform live in both semi-finals and the final, having tested positive of the virus.  A pre-recorded performance of ''DaÃ°i og GagnamagniÃ°'' was played, which finished fourth, receiving 378 points, 12 more than [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] singer {{w|Go_A}}'s song ''{{w|Shum_(song)|Shum}}''.

Switzerland finished at top, during the jury voting, receiving 267 points.  France finished second during the natioanl jury voiting with 248 points.  During the jury voting, when France and Switzerland were very close to each other, Pravi said, "I think it is crazy that two French songs are on the top, thank you!"  National juries of both Switzerland and the UK awarded 12 points to France.  Pravi uttered ''{{translated quote|fr|French language|Merci!|Thank you!}}'', clapped and blew a kiss towards the Swiss team, upon receiving 12 points from the Swiss jury.
